A very fast single-header C99 AVX2-accelerated lexer that does not use any
tables, can be customized by manipulating macros and is on average 3-5 times
faster than corresponding flex lexer.

Nice things about it:
* No code generation, include and call a function
* No tables, custom language, etc
* Simple API
* It's fast
* Can define you own callback (through macros) on each token for advanced usage
* Handles some tricky things, which some "example" flex files don't, like
  BACKSLASH-LF in string and single-line comments, CR-LF line endings etc

It should work out of a box, but it's more of a prove-of-concept right now,
probably if you fuzz it, you will get tones of bugs (although some tests are
included, so not many "trivial" bugs should happen).

Examples comming soon, I hope
